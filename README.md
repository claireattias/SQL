This activity looks at data from six CSV files containing information on previous employees at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). The csv files are imported into a SQL database (PostgreSQL) and tables are designed to hold the data from the CSV files.

The activity is divided into three parts: 

Data Modeling
-
- CSV files are inspected and an Entity Relation Diagram of the tables is composed.

Data Engineering
-
- Table schemas for each of the six CSV files are created (specifying the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints)
- CSV files are imported into corresponding SQL table

Data Analysis
-
- Data is explored to answer questions regarding previous employees
